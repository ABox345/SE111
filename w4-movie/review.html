        Wreck-it Ralph is such a good movie about video games. It is probably my most watched movie of all time, if i had to estimate the amount of time ive watched this movie it would be around 90 times.
        Im pretty sure I can recite atleast half of the movie by heart. The movie has so many great refrences to games old and new.

            <ul>
                <li>Originally, Ralph was animated as his original 8 bit self</li>
                <li>The train station of Niceland shows a population of 224x256, which is the resolution of an 8-bit game</li>
                <li>Nintendo asked the animators of the movie to change how bowser holds a tea cup as he is royalty and would not hold it by grasping the entire cup</li>
